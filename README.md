# teacher-transparent
An app that allows teachers to communicate student behavior to guardians with only a few clicks

Right now this app is in it's alpha, standalone state, meaning it does not allow sharing of student information between teachers.
This means that all student data has to be entered by each teacher instead of gaining access to student data for that school remotely.

Future proposed alterations: 
- provide student data remotely by authorising teachers with logins to specific datasets
- add behavior events to log file to track student behavior
- update UI to something better
- refactor to use android resources instead of hard-coding
- translate to other languages
- fix some small issues with back stack and fragments
